--------------------
Import "Reflection.java" to your "src" folder in your project. Try to use reflection and print some information about this class. Print everything on a new line:

•	This class type

•	Super class type 

•	All interfaces that are implemented by this class

•	Instantiate object using reflection and print it too

**Don’t change anything in "Reflection class"!**

2.Getters and Setters:
please click here for the code: https://github.com/MariaIvanova01/Reflection/tree/ReflectionMethods
-------------------------------
Use reflection to get all Reflection methods. Then prepare an algorithm that will recognize, which methods are getters and setters. Sort each collection alphabetically by methods names. Print to console each getter on a new line in the format:

•	"{name} will return class {Return Type}"

Then print all setters in the format:

•	"{name} and will set field of class {Parameter Type}"

**Do this without changing anything in "Reflection.java"**

3.High Quality Mistakes:

------------------------------------------
You are already an expert on High-Quality Code, so you know what kind of access modifiers must be set for members of the class. The time for revenge has come. Now you have to check the code produced by your "Beautiful and Smart" trainers in class Reflection. Check all fields and methods access modifiers. Sort each category of members alphabetically. Print on the console all mistakes in the format:

•	For Fields: 
"{fieldName} must be private!"

•	For Getters:
"{methodName} have to be public!"

•	For Setters:
"{methodName} have to be private!"
